## Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects to improve and learn new skills
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, React, React Native and Node.js
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my small projects and programming skills.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about animes, video games, astronomy and motocycle.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in japan until my 13 years, and I can speak japanese fluently. Also I am a huge fan of geek and japanese culture.
